ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Trend Prediction using LSTM
Project Overview
This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to predict future stock closing prices based on historical trends. The project utilizes the yfinance API for data retrieval and deep learning libraries like Keras/TensorFlow for model development. Additionally, it incorporates classical technical analysis indicators (Moving Average and RSI) to provide comprehensive trend analysis.

Objectives
Fetch historical stock data using the yfinance API.

Preprocess and normalize data to create sequential inputs suitable for the LSTM model.

Design, train, and validate a deep learning model to forecast prices.

Visualize the model's predictions against actual market data.

Calculate and plot key technical indicators (SMA and RSI).

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Prerequisites
You need Python 3.x installed. The project relies on several key libraries.

Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip.

BASH
# Clone the repository (if hosted on Git)
# git clone <your-repo-link>
# cd stock-price-prediction

# Install all required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib tensorflow yfinance scikit-learn

Execution
The entire project is structured as a single, executable Jupyter Notebook.

Open the Jupyter Notebook (or Google Colab environment).

Ensure the runtime is set to GPU (Runtime -> Change runtime type) for faster training.

Run all cells sequentially.

ðŸ§  Model & Methodology
Data Preprocessing
Data Source: Yahoo Finance API (yfinance).

Target Variable: Daily Close Price.

Scaling: Data is scaled between 0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler to stabilize the model training process.

Time Series Preparation: A 60-day look-back window (TIME_STEP = 60) is used, meaning the model uses the previous 60 closing prices to predict the price on the 61st day.

âœ¨ Results and Visualizations
The notebook generates three key plots:

1. LSTM Price Prediction
This plot shows the separation of the training data from the validation data, contrasting the actual closing prices against the model's forecasted prices over the validation period.

2. Moving Average (MA) Analysis
Plots the stock price alongside its 50-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200-day SMA, useful for identifying long-term trend direction and support/resistance levels.

3. Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Plots the 14-day RSI, an oscillating indicator used to identify overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions.

ðŸ’» Optional: Streamlit Dashboard
For an interactive dashboard, an optional app.py script can be deployed using Streamlit. This allows users to input a ticker symbol and immediately see the latest predictions and indicators generated by the trained model.
